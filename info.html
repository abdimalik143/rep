   <h1 class="description" style="color: #A3BA9C;">Description:</h1>
   <p class="paragraph">Cyaneopubescens, also known as the Green Bottle Blue, is one of the most colorful tarantula species in the hobby. This New World, semi-arboreal species is found in Northern Venezuela. Although they are land dwellers that can burrow, they also enjoy elevated places to climb and create intricate webbed structures. They have a medium growth rate, with males maturing in around 1.5 years and females in around 2+ years. While they possess mild venom and urticating hairs, they are relatively easy to care for and recommended for beginners.</p>

   <h1 class="description">Housing:</h1>
   <p class="paragraph">Given that C. cyaneopubescens is semi-arboreal, a hybrid setup with both terrestrial and arboreal elements is ideal. Fill about 1/3 of the enclosure with substrate and add tall anchor points like cork barks and sticks. The enclosure should be 3x the leg span of the spider in length and width, with at least 2x the leg span in height. Maintain humidity around 50-60% with a shallow water dish and occasional misting. Ensure good ventilation and clean the enclosure every few months.</p>

   <h2 class="description">Feeding:</h2>
   <p class="paragraph">Feed slings fruit flies or pre-killed mealworms, and juveniles/adults a variety of insects around the size of the spider's abdomen. Feed once or twice a week for slings and once a week or bi-weekly for adults. Avoid feeding live prey unattended and remove uneaten food after 24 hours to prevent pests and mold.</p>

   <h2 class="description">Additional Remarks:</h2>
   <p class="paragraph">Tarantulas are generally solitary and should not be kept communally. They grow by moulting, which can take from a month to several months. During moulting, do not disturb them as it can lead to stress and deformities.</p>
